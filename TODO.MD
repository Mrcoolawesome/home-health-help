What todo when i get back
 - Probably gonna have to make a seperate sortby function for each thing we sort by, because everything needs to be sorted a little differently. 
 - I think to do this we should make each card have an object with the 'important data' stored in it (we should define 'important data' and make that list (or whatever structure we choose to make it) available for all files in this project to be able to view)
    - Then, we can make what are esentially custom sort functions to customly sort them by whatever thing they choose.
